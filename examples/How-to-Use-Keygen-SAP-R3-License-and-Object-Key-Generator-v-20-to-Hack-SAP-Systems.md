## What is Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0)?
 
Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0) is an executable file that was developed by a company called IWR. It has a description of "SAP R/3 License and Object Key Generator" and a version of 1.1.0.0[^1^]. It is supposed to generate developer keys and object keys for any SAP system, regardless of the version or patch level.
 
Developer keys and object keys are codes that SAP uses to protect its standard code from unauthorized changes. They are required when you want to create or modify ABAP objects in the SAP system. Normally, you have to request these keys from SAP through the SSCR (SAP Software Change Registration) procedure[^2^]. However, some people use Keygen (SAP R3 License and Object Key Generator v 2.0) to generate these keys without contacting SAP.
